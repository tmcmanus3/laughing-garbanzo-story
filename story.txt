Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Saul. Saul was from the streets of Leningrad in 1950s Russia. He had no parents, no family to speak of other than an old mutt that followed him around begging for scraps. Paul was kind enough to give the mutt his leftovers, however, one day, the old mutt disappeared and was no where to be found. After a while, he disappeared into the alleyways and was never seen again.
